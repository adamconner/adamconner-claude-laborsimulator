## 🎯 Long-term Vision

1. **Multi-country comparison** - Side-by-side simulation of AI impact across economies (US, EU, China, etc.). Users can run parallel scenarios to see how different labor market structures, regulatory environments, and skill distributions affect outcomes. Includes cross-border supply chain effects and international competition dynamics.

2. **Machine learning forecasting** - Integrate trained ML models for more accurate predictions based on historical labor market transitions. Use time series forecasting, neural networks trained on BLS historical data, and natural language processing to analyze job posting trends and predict emerging skill demands.

3. **Real-time scenario updates** - Connect live data feeds (BLS monthly releases, Fed announcements, AI company earnings) directly into running simulations. Scenarios automatically adjust parameters when new data arrives, with notifications when real-world events significantly deviate from projected outcomes.

4. **Collaborative scenarios** - Enable multiple users to build and share scenarios in real-time with commenting and version control. Teams can propose alternative intervention strategies, run A/B comparisons, and collaboratively refine assumptions—ideal for policy workshops and academic research groups.

5. **Policy recommendation engine** - AI-powered optimization that suggests the most effective combination of interventions given user-specified objectives (minimize unemployment, maximize wage growth, stay within budget). Uses reinforcement learning trained on thousands of simulated scenarios to find Pareto-optimal policy mixes.
