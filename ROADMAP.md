- [ ] Sector interdependency effects

#### New Intervention Types
- [x] Negative Income Tax (alternative to UBI)
- [ ] Skills-based immigration policy
- [ ] Public-private retraining partnerships
- [x] Gig economy regulations
- [x] AI licensing/certification requirements
- [x] Worker ownership/co-op incentives
- [x] Sectoral bargaining support
- [x] Universal basic services (healthcare, housing, childcare)

### Medium Priority

#### Enhanced Visualizations
- [ ] Sankey diagrams for labor flow
- [ ] Animated job transition visualization
- [ ] Regional heat maps
- [ ] Skill gap radar charts
- [ ] Comparative policy dashboards

#### Data Sources
- [ ] International labor markets (EU, UK, Canada)
- [ ] Real-time job posting data integration
- [ ] AI adoption surveys
- [ ] Skills taxonomy updates

### Lower Priority
